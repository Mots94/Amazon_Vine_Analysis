# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The Amazon Vine program provides members with products free of charge, and in exchange members must document and publish a product review.  Since this differs from typical customers who pay for the same products, there is the potential for positive review bias to influence the reviews of vine members.  In order to test this, a dataset of watch reviews from both program and non-program individuals was analyzed using PySpark in Google Colab.
